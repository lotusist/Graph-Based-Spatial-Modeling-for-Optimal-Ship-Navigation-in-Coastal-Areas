# Graph-Based Spatial Modeling for Optimal Ship Navigation in Coastal Areas

- This study proposes a methodology for constructing a high-resolution graph structure that can be practically applied for optimal ship navigation in coastal areas, which is challenging due to their complex topology.
- In addition to geographic data, this study proposes a method to utilize ship trajectory data to guide vessels along optimal routes for safe navigation in coastal areas.
- This study also implements a methodology to identify optimal paths based on ship characteristics, such as type and tonnage. Specifically, it addresses the optimal paths for fishing vessels, which previous research has not explored.
